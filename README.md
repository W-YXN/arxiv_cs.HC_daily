# Daily ArXiv HCI

A curated collection of arXiv papers with open-source implementations, specifically focusing on Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) and related fields like Computer Graphics (cs.GR), Computer Vision (cs.CV), etc. This repository aims to serve researchers and practitioners in HCI by providing easy access to papers that come with their source code implementations.

## Overview
This project automatically tracks and analyzes papers from relevant HCI categories on arXiv daily using GitHub Actions. It specifically identifies and catalogs papers that have released their source code, making it easier for researchers in HCI and related areas to find implementable research work.

The main features include:
- Daily updates of papers with open-source implementations
- Focus on Human-Computer Interaction and related research
- Automatic tracking and organization
